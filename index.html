                    Hi <span class="VERBALChar memberDisplay">MEMBER</span>? Hey <span class="VERBALChar memberDisplay">MEMBER</span>, this is <span class="VERBALChar agentDisplay">AGENT</span> with American Income. Did your (RELATIONSHIP) <span class="VERBALChar sponsorDisplay">SPONSOR</span> let you know I would be giving you a call?
                    <p><strong>If NO:</strong> They didn't? <span class="TECHNICALChar">Act surprised</span> Well, <span class="VERBALChar sponsorDisplay">SPONSOR</span> promised me they would tell you about it! No worries though! They probably wanted me to explain it to you personally.</p>
                    <p><strong>If YES:</strong> Great!</p>

                    <span class="phone-step">REASON FOR CALLING</span><br>
                    So I was calling because <span class="VERBALChar sponsorDisplay">SPONSOR</span> sponsored you in to receive our free union benefits program. Basically, it's a benefit package that comes with a nice healthcare discount, a child safety kit, which protects the kids if any in the event of an emergency, a free will kit, and a permanent family care program. Do you have a spouse or significant other that you usually handle important information with or is it usually just you?

                    <span class="phone-step">SETTING THE APPOINTMENT</span><br>
                    We do everything over a quick video meeting. Did I catch you at work or did I catch you at home? <strong>SWITCH TO INSTANT IF HOME</strong><br>
                    <p><strong>If not home:</strong> So I do run a pretty busy schedule but I do have some time available today, would later on today be good for you?</p>
                    <p><strong>If yes:</strong> Okay perfect, I have a TIME and TIME available, which one works best?</p>
                    <p><strong>If no:</strong> So, when would be a good day for you? Okay perfect, I do run a super busy schedule but I do have a TIME and TIME available then, which one works best for you?</p>

                    <span class="phone-step">SOLIDIFY THE APPOINTMENT</span><br>
                    Okay perfect, What’s a good email for you? And Is this a good number to text? I’m going to send you a confirmation message and a couple reminders. Now if something comes up promise me that you will shoot me a message, this is my personal line that we’re on. Now, <span class="VERBALChar memberDisplay">MEMBER</span>, if I save that spot for you then I can’t save it for another family. Do you see ANY reason why DAY at TIME would not work? It's very IMPORTANT that you’re both there. Sound good? Awesome! I’ll be on DAY at TIME. If for some reason I’m running behind, I’ll be sure to call you.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Extra Solidification:</strong> Okay great! Do me a favor, go ahead and grab a pen and paper (or pull up the notes app on your phone), I have some very important information that I need you to put down. Let me know when you’re ready.<br>
                    First, please write down my name: Kaeden<br>
                    Next, please write down the appointment time: DAY at TIME<br>
                    And lastly we’ll be using Zoom Meeting, so please make sure you have it downloaded before our meeting. I will be sending the meeting information before our appointment.

Hey <span class="VERBALChar memberDisplay">MEMBER</span>, this is <span class="VERBALChar agentDisplay">AGENT</span> with American Income. Did your (RELATIONSHIP) <span class="VERBALChar sponsorDisplay">SPONSOR</span> let you know I would be giving you a call?<br>
                    Thats good the reason I am calling is because <span class="VERBALChar policyholderDisplay">POLICYHOLDER</span> listed you as an emergency contact on their life insurance policy and my job is to setup a quick 10-15 minute meeting with you (and spouse) to go over your responsibilities for being on their policy. We do everything over zoom and its super easy to use. Did I catch you at work or are you at home?
                    <p><strong>If "No":</strong> Okay, no problem (move to set appointment)</p>
                    <p><strong>If "Yes":</strong> Okay perfect (roll into appointment)</p>

                    <span class="phone-step">SETTING THE APPOINTMENT</span><br>

                    Thats good, I was calling because it looks like since your policy has been active for # years now, I guess there’s an update for you and they need a manager going over that with you and the spouse on a 10-15 minute phone call. Did I catch you at work or are you at home?

                    Thats good, I was calling because it looks like your policy had lapsed a while ago, did you happen to change banks or put a lock on your account?
                    <p><strong>If "No" or they cancelled:</strong> Okay, no problem, what may have been the reason? (try to resell)</p>
                    <p><strong>If "Yes":</strong> Okay perfect, I guess that's why they had me reach out to you, we can get this taken care of in 10-15 minutes, did I catch you at home or did I catch you at work?</p>

                    <p><strong>COD MOD:</strong> I was calling with great news because it looks like you got fully approved for your policy and everything’s good to go. It’s going to be $##.## a month for REVIEW COVERAGE. Is that still comfortable? (if not do PSR to adjust price) Okay perfect, it will draft within 1-5 business days. If you need anything just give me a call, do you have any questions about your coverage before I let you go? Okay great have a great day!</p>
