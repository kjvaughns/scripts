                <p>That’s good, they had me reach out to you I guess since your policy has been active for # years now, there's a quick update and review and they need a manager going over that with you (and spouse) on a 10-15 minute phone call and I was calling to see if you had a piece of paper or pencil or maybe notes on your phone to take some notes.</p>
                <p>If <strong>"Yes"</strong>: Okay perfect (roll into appointment)</p>
                <p>If <strong>"No"</strong>: Okay, no problem (move to set appointment)</p>
