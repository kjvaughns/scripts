                    Hi <span class="VERBALChar memberDisplay">MEMBER</span>? Hey <span class="VERBALChar memberDisplay">MEMBER</span>, this is <span class="VERBALChar agentDisplay">AGENT</span> with American Income. Did your (RELATIONSHIP) <span class="VERBALChar sponsorDisplay">SPONSOR</span> let you know I would be giving you a call?
                    <p><strong>If NO:</strong> They didn't? <span class="TECHNICALChar">Act surprised</span> Well, <span class="VERBALChar sponsorDisplay">SPONSOR</span> promised me they would tell you about it! No worries though! They probably wanted me to explain it to you personally.</p>
                    <p><strong>If YES:</strong> Great!</p>

                    <span class="phone-step">REASON FOR CALLING</span><br>
                    So I was calling because <span class="VERBALChar sponsorDisplay">SPONSOR</span> sponsored you in to receive our free union benefits program. Basically, it's a benefit package that comes with a nice healthcare discount, a child safety kit, which protects the kids if any in the event of an emergency, a free will kit, and a permanent family care program. Do you have a spouse or significant other that you usually handle important information with or is it usually just you?

                    <span class="phone-step">SETTING THE APPOINTMENT</span><br>
                    We do everything over a quick video meeting. Did I catch you at work or did I catch you at home? <strong>SWITCH TO INSTANT IF HOME</strong><br>
                    <p><strong>If not home:</strong> So I do run a pretty busy schedule but I do have some time available today, would later on today be good for you?</p>
                    <p><strong>If yes:</strong> Okay perfect, I have a TIME and TIME available, which one works best?</p>
                    <p><strong>If no:</strong> So, when would be a good day for you? Okay perfect, I do run a super busy schedule but I do have a TIME and TIME available then, which one works best for you?</p>

                    <span class="phone-step">SOLIDIFY THE APPOINTMENT</span><br>
                    Okay perfect, What’s a good email for you? And Is this a good number to text? I’m going to send you a confirmation message and a couple reminders. Now if something comes up promise me that you will shoot me a message, this is my personal line that we’re on. Now, <span class="VERBALChar memberDisplay">MEMBER</span>, if I save that spot for you then I can’t save it for another family. Do you see ANY reason why DAY at TIME would not work? It's very IMPORTANT that you’re both there. Sound good? Awesome! I’ll be on DAY at TIME. If for some reason I’m running behind, I’ll be sure to call you.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Extra Solidification:</strong> Okay great! Do me a favor, go ahead and grab a pen and paper (or pull up the notes app on your phone), I have some very important information that I need you to put down. Let me know when you’re ready.<br>
                    First, please write down my name: Kaeden<br>
                    Next, please write down the appointment time: DAY at TIME<br>
                    And lastly we’ll be using Zoom Meeting, so please make sure you have it downloaded before our meeting. I will be sending the meeting information before our appointment.

                    <p>(IF OLDER) Hi <span class="VERBALChar memberDisplay">MEMBER</span>? Hey <span class="VERBALChar memberDisplay">MEMBER</span>, this is <span class="VERBALChar agentDisplay">AGENT</span> with American Income, your <span class="VERBALChar sponsorDisplay">SPONSOR</span>'s life insurance company. How are you doing today?<br>
                    <p>Thats good the reason I am calling is because <span class="VERBALChar policyholderDisplay">POLICYHOLDER</span> listed you as an emergency contact on their life insurance policy and my job is to setup a quick 10-15 minute meeting with you (and spouse) to go over your responsibilities for being on their policy. We do everything over zoom and its super easy to use. Did I catch you at work or are you at home?
                    <p><strong>If "No":</strong> Okay, no problem (move to set appointment)</p>
                    <p><strong>If "Yes":</strong> Okay perfect (roll into appointment)</p>

                    <span class="phone-step">SETTING THE APPOINTMENT</span><br>
                    My schedule is super booked up, what time do you and the spouse normally get home from work?

                    Hi <span class="VERBALChar memberDisplay">MEMBER</span>? Hey <span class="VERBALChar memberDisplay">MEMBER</span>, this is <span class="VERBALChar agentDisplay">AGENT</span> with American Income Life, your life insurance company, how are you doing?<br>
                    Thats good, I was calling because it looks like since your policy has been active for # years now, I guess there’s an update for you and they need a manager going over that with you and the spouse on a 10-15 minute phone call. Did I catch you at work or are you at home?
                    <p><strong>If "No":</strong> Okay, no problem (move to set appointment)</p>
                    <p><strong>If "Yes":</strong> Okay perfect, go ahead and grab a piece of paper and pencil real quick (roll into appointment)</p>
                    <p><strong>If "I Dont Have A Policy(Discount Card)":</strong> You do, that would be your accidental policy that was set up for you through our company. It says here you got that set up (Renewal date on discount card, minus one year.) It sounds like you may not have gotten a copy sent out, which is why I was reaching out to update your membership, and review the additional no cost benefit plan that's attached.</p>

                    Thats good, I was calling in regards to a policy you got setup for INSURED back in (MM/YY), but it ended up lapsing, did you happen to change banks or did you end up cancelling the policy? 
                    <p><strong>If "Change Banks" or they are unsure:</strong> Okay, no problem, its a super easy fix on our end (move to set appointment)</p>
                    <p><strong>If "Cancelled":</strong> Well, if you don't mind me asking ___, was it something that we did as a company or was it more just a decision on your guys part for the cancellation of that policy??</p>

                    <span class="phone-step">SETTING THE APPOINTMENT</span><br>
                    So the reason for my call ___ is that we have actually adjusted a lot of our programs to make them a lot more affordable to our members and the compaby found that a lot of the members were re-evaluating their situation, so the company just had a manager to reach out to setup a quick 10-15 minute phone call to see if you qualify for our reopen process. Are you at home right now or are you at work?

                    <p><strong>If "Work":</strong> Okay, no problem, I was hoping to get you in either later today or tomorrow, which day works best for you? (set appointment)</p>
                    <p><strong>If "Home":</strong> Okay perfect, well if you could grab a quick pen and paper real quick while I get your file opened up, by the way I know its been a while but how much do you remember about your policy?  (roll into appointment)</p>

Now, the good news is—it’s a super easy fix, and I can take care of everything right now in about 5 minutes so you don’t lose your coverage or have to go through reapplying.
                    <p>All I need to do is submit a quick form and update your payment info to process the coverage again. The next premium will draft in the next [2-7 for reopen, 7-14 for reinstatement] days, and you’ll be all set. Now, For your monthly draft, do you still want it to come out on [previous date], or would another date work better?
                    <p> Alright, and just to make sure everything runs smoothly, which account do you want this to come from? I can take your updated banking info now, and then I’ll send over a quick form for you to confirm.  
                    <p> Give me just a quick minute while I submit this real quick, I’m going to send the paperwork to you now for your approval. Hang tight for a sec while I get that over…
